Subject: The Krpatsky Project

Gentlemen let me be the first to welcome you to the Krpatsky project. For
those of you who have not already been briefed allow me to elaborate on the
nature of this project. Due to the rapid growth of the Advanced Research
Projects Agency Network or ARPANET concerns have been raised in regards to
the security of this network. It wasn’t until the recent breach of the
######### system that the scope of this problem was revealed. The
administrators of the various systems used in this attack were completely
unaware of any unauthorized activity. This has led many to the conclusion
that the security of the ARPANET as a whole cannot be trusted to individual
system administrators.

With Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in full swing we've been granted
funding to build a system capable of overseeing the entire ARPANET. To aid
us in this endeavor General Stuart has guaranteed us the following: priority
access to all ################ and #################, a remote facility with
high physical security, and all the funding we need. To make the most of this
support we’ve recruited the best and brightest software and hardware engineers
for this project. I know working in a remote location such as ours will be
stressful at times, but let me assure that this project is essential to the
security of our nation. We begin, officially, on the ## of ###########.

Follow ALL security protocols and DO NOT mention the project outside the
island. This is a classified project and treason is a very real punishment.
Remember, the safety of all U.S. virtual strategic intelligence rests in our
hands.

Sincerely,
Karl Hopper

Subject: The infiltration method

I've gotten the infiltration method worked out. OSIA can handle about 100ish
simultaneous connections which means we can infiltrate 100 hosts at once.
The exact process is as follows:

1. Pull the first 25 hosts off the 'high risk' list
2. Pick another 75 hosts at random
3. Get the OS of the first host and pull the matching OS from our database
4. Have the Supercalculator intelligently search for exploits
5. Breach and root the host using any exploits found
6. Inteligently inspect the system and logs for signs of unauthorized use
7. Restore all offending files to their prior state and remove all access logs
8. Disconnect and repeat step 3 - 8 with the next host

This process should take about an hour per host. OSIA may be smart but it still
takes time to check through this many files. Additionally, if anyone manages to
back-connect to us OSIA will immediately disconnect from the host used to
infiltrate the system and then run a trace through the ######### ##### to find
the attacker. We can then send a payload to his terminal disconnecting it from
network.

We're nearing the testing phase. I just want to confirm that the backend and
database are ready to go.

Sincerely,
Karl Hopper

Subject: Bad news

I've just received word that our funding has been pulled. Project krpatsky is
dead. I want to thank each and every one of you for the hard work and
dedication you have put into this project. While it might not have succeeded
we've made great strides in the fields of machine learning and quantum
computing among others. I wish you luck in your future endeavors.

Be prepared to leave tomorrow; Riker will fill you in on departure tonight.

Farewell,
Hopper

Subject: Saving this project

Strauss, it's no secret that hopper's test run was a complete failure. A lot of
team members think that what we're attempting won't be possible for another 30
years. However, I think we can still salvage this project. We cannot let what
we've built here go to waste. If this project gets shutdown, we'll be throwing
away what could be one of the USA's most powerful weapons. I've tried to
convince Hopper to change the objective of the project but he's dead set on
doing things his way.

I'm working on a plan.

If you're interested, leave a red pen in the top right drawer of my desk.
Also, delete this email as soon as you finish reading it. If OSIA sees this
email we're going to be in some hot water. If you tell anyone else about this
I'll let slip about those files you leaked.

If you don't want to be a part of this, I can respect that. Just pretend this
conversation didn't happen.

Subject: The plan

I'm glad that you're on board with the plan. As you know, the Krpatsky project
was officially killed, but my plan has just begun. Pay attention closely then
delete this email.

I planted a logic bombs of sorts in the 'shutdown' command on the
supercalculator. The shutdown command will put OSIA into a low power mode for
one month then reboot system. This should fool the cleanup team.

Additionally, I've written a remote access program for OSIA called
"projectk.exe". When OSIA reboots it should scatter the prog across the
ARPANET along with several other hacking programs that will aid you in
completing my plan.

projectk.exe will fetch a set of instructions for you to follow; however,
the program is encrypted. It will crash if you try to run it without entering
the decryption key as the first parameter.

Unfortunately, I have some heat on me right now and have to lay low. I trust
that you can handle this.

Good luck,
Rikers

Subject: The test run

The testrun today was a total failure. OSIA was unable to get root access on
the target host. This isn't something we can fix. We simply don't have enough
processing power to pull this off and likely won't for another 30 years. Hopper
realizes this too, but he's refusing to admit defeat. This project means a lot
to him and he wants to go down with the ship.

I think we can still salvage krpatsky for something else. It was able to
breach the target host with ease today. I wonder how well it'd work on a
soviet system.

Talk to hopper, see if you can convince him to change his mind on the matter.
If not, then we should consider our options.

General Strauss,

Here's our requisition list. Please forward this request to your people. I
have approved everything on this list including the atomic batteries. Let me
know if you have any questions regarding the project.

We're making great progress here.

PS: ok, the decryption key is... personalized, i guess... you have to visit krpatsky and open the specific file to get it. that's why i put in n/a.
